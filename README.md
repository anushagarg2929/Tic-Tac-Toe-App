# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

In your childhood u might have played this game on the back side of your notebook whether calling it a x-o game. So here comes the digital visualization of it. This game will declare you the winner if you make three consecutive patterns from counters whether horizontally, vertically or in diagonal ways.

I have learnt and implemented various new things in this app such as grid layout, animations(Fading, rotation, scaling, etc.) and improved my media usuage in android studio.
